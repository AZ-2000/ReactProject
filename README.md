# React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Information about the project
 To run the project you will have to install Visual Studio Code and run the application by uploading the folder on vsCode, make 
 sure you have NodeJS installed and  go to the Terminal. Type npm start and the project should run.
 The project will only run on React version 18.2.3 or higher.
 Dependencies used were Bootstrap 4, Node 21.1.0 , tsparticles, react-router-dom.
 The images that were used were taken from the internet.

 Only clicking on the linkedin icon in the contact-me form leads to an external site as it is the only social media account I 
 found proper to link here.
 ## DO NOT
import older versions of react-particles-js as it does not work with newer versions of react and causes problems for the navigation side of things by clashing with react-router-dom.
