# React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Information about the project
 To run the project you will have to install Visual Studio Code and create a react application through npx create-react-app.  
 The project will only run on React version 18.2.3 or higher.
 Dependencies used were Bootstrap 4, Node 21.1.0 , tsparticles, react-router-dom.
 The images that were used were taken from the internet.

 ## DO NOT
import older versions of react-particles-js as it does not work with newer versions of react and causes problems for the navigation side of things by clashing with react-router-dom.
